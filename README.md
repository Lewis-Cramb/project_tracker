# project_tracker
This will be a java program to track my AE due dates, exam dates and anything else important (like a calender)

# notes
- Between commit 4 and 5 I considered adding a new package, courses, and adding .java class files for each course however this seemed redundant as there is no needed information other than the name - may come back to this as a way to sort by course 
- Between commit 4 and 5 I decided to work on the basic system first before moving on to the GUI using swing (or other, when time comes will pick)


# Commit history

f0fa17e - First commit, created java project from scratch without vscode to test it runs and everything pushes correctly.

dac5379 - Second commit, added packages and create a class for exams to be added to.

9365d15 - Third commit, created basic wireframes for the main site and what it will look like.

3fd1d36 - Fourth commit, converted the assessment basics to an interface and added the assessed exercise class

[commit num] - Fifth commit, switched from interface to abstract parent and sub classes - a much better approach that I didn't consider for some reason when doing the last commit. Plan to test scanner to enable assessment input without gui and will start relearning and using gui stuff once this is implemented.
